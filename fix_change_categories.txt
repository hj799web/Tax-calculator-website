Replace the CHANGE_CATEGORIES constant in src/domains/budget/store/budgetSimulator.js (around line 21):

OLD:
const CHANGE_CATEGORIES = {
  INCOME_TAXES: 'Income Taxes',
  CONSUMPTION_TAXES: 'Consumption Taxes', 
  OTHER_REVENUE: 'Other Revenue',
  MAIN_SPENDING: 'Main Spending',
  LOANS_INVESTMENTS: 'Loans & Investments',
  GOVERNMENT_OPS: 'Government Operations',
  TAX_CREDITS: 'Tax Credits & Deductions'
};

NEW:
const CHANGE_CATEGORIES = {
  INCOME_TAXES: 'Income Taxes',
  CONSUMPTION_TAXES: 'Consumption Taxes', 
  OTHER_REVENUE: 'Other Revenue',
  MAIN_SPENDING: 'Main Spending',
  LOANS_INVESTMENTS: 'Loans & Investments',
  GOVERNMENT_OPS: 'Government Operations',
  TAX_CREDITS: 'Tax Credits & Deductions',
  SYSTEM_ACTIONS: 'System Actions'
};
