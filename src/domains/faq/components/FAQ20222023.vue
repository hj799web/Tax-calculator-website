    <h2>FAQ - 2022-2023 Budget</h2>
    
    <h3>How accurate is the calculator?</h3>
    <p>The calculator provides a close estimate based on the information you provide and the latest tax rates. However, it's a simplified model and doesn't account for all possible deductions, credits, or special situations.</p>
    
    <h3>Does the calculator store my data?</h3>
    <p>No, all calculations are performed in your browser. No personal or financial information is stored on our servers.</p>
    
    <h3>How often is the calculator updated?</h3>
    <p>We update the calculator annually to reflect changes in tax rates, brackets, and government spending allocations. The current version uses 2022-2023 tax rates.</p>
    
    <h3>Can I use the calculator for business taxes?</h3>
    <p>The calculator is designed for personal income taxes. Business taxes involve different rules and considerations.</p>
    
    <h3>How are the government spending allocations determined?</h3>
    <p>The spending allocations are based on the Public Accounts of Canada, which provide detailed breakdowns of federal government expenditures.</p>
    
    <h3>Does the calculator account for all possible tax credits?</h3>
    <p>The calculator includes major credits like the basic personal amount and simplified child credits, but doesn't account for all possible credits like medical expenses, tuition, or charitable donations.</p>
