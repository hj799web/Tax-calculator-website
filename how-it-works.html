        <p>The Canada Tax Calculator is a comprehensive, user-friendly tool designed to help Canadians understand their tax obligations and see how their tax dollars contribute to government spending. This documentation explains the calculator's methodology, features, and benefits.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="calculator-methodology" class="section">
        <h2>Calculator Methodology</h2>
        
        <h3>Tax Rates and Brackets</h3>
        <p>The Canada Tax Calculator uses the latest 2024 federal and provincial tax rates and brackets to provide accurate tax estimates. The calculator includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Federal Tax Brackets: Five progressive tax brackets ranging from 15% to 33%</li>
            <li>Provincial/Territorial Tax Brackets: Specific brackets for all 13 provinces and territories</li>
            <li>CPP/QPP Contributions: Calculated based on employment income with appropriate maximums</li>
            <li>EI Premiums: Calculated based on employment income with appropriate maximums</li>
            <li><strong>Quebec-Specific Features:</strong> The calculator includes special Quebec tax considerations including Quebec abatement, QPIP contributions, and Quebec-specific rates for EI and QPP</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Basic Personal Amounts</h3>
        <p>The calculator accounts for both federal and provincial basic personal amounts (BPA), which are non-refundable tax credits that reduce the amount of tax you pay:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Federal Basic Personal Amount: $15,705 (2024)</li>
            <li>Provincial Basic Personal Amounts: Vary by province/territory</li>
            <li>Quebec Basic Personal Amount: $18,000 (2024) - Higher than most provinces</li>
            <li>Adjusted BPA for Marital Status: Increased BPA for individuals who are married or in common-law relationships</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div id="tax-calculation-process" class="section">
        <h2>Tax Calculation Process</h2>
        <p>The calculator follows these steps to determine your tax obligations:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Collect Income Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Employment income</li>
            <li>Self-employment income</li>
            <li>Capital gains (before and after June 25, 2024)</li>
            <li>Eligible and ineligible dividends</li>
            <li>Other income sources</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Apply Deductions and Credits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>RRSP deductions</li>
            <li>Basic personal amounts</li>
            <li>Dependent credits</li>
            <li>Child credits</li>
            <li>Dividend tax credits</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Calculate Federal Tax</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine taxable income</li>
            <li>Apply federal tax rates to appropriate income brackets</li>
            <li>Apply Quebec abatement (16.5% reduction) for Quebec residents</li>
            <li>Subtract applicable tax credits</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Calculate Provincial/Territorial Tax</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply provincial/territorial tax rates to appropriate income brackets</li>
            <li>Subtract applicable provincial tax credits</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Calculate CPP/QPP and EI Contributions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>CPP/QPP: 5.7% of employment income (11.4% for self-employed) up to maximum</li>
            <li>Quebec QPP: 6.4% of employment income (12.8% for self-employed) with $3,500 exemption</li>
            <li>EI: 1.63% of employment income up to maximum</li>
            <li>Quebec EI: 1.32% of employment income (lower rate than federal)</li>
            <li>Quebec QPIP: 0.494% of employment income up to $91,000 (Quebec only)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6. Determine Net Income</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Subtract total tax (federal + provincial + CPP/QPP + EI + QPIP for Quebec) from gross income</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div id="quebec-specific-features" class="section">
        <h2>Quebec-Specific Tax Features</h2>
        <p>Quebec has unique tax rules that differ from other Canadian provinces. The calculator accounts for these Quebec-specific considerations:</p>
        
        <h3>Quebec Abatement</h3>
        <p>Quebec residents receive a 16.5% reduction on their federal basic tax. This is because Quebec administers its own tax system and collects federal taxes on behalf of the federal government.</p>
        
        <h3>Quebec Tax Brackets (2024)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>15% on income up to $51,780</li>
            <li>20% on income from $51,780 to $103,545</li>
            <li>24% on income from $103,545 to $126,000</li>
            <li>25.75% on income above $126,000</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)</h3>
        <p>Quebec uses its own pension plan instead of the federal CPP:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate: 6.4% (vs 5.7% for CPP)</li>
            <li>Basic exemption: $3,500</li>
            <li>Maximum pensionable earnings: $68,500</li>
            <li>Maximum annual contribution: $4,160</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Quebec Employment Insurance (EI)</h3>
        <p>Quebec has a lower EI rate than other provinces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate: 1.32% (vs 1.63% federal rate)</li>
            <li>Maximum insurable earnings: $63,200</li>
            <li>Maximum annual contribution: $834</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP)</h3>
        <p>Quebec has its own parental insurance system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate: 0.494%</li>
            <li>Maximum insurable earnings: $91,000</li>
            <li>Maximum annual contribution: $449</li>
            <li>This is mandatory for all Quebec residents with employment income</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Quebec Basic Personal Amount</h3>
        <p>Quebec offers a higher basic personal amount than most provinces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2024 amount: $18,000 (vs $15,705 federal)</li>
            <li>This provides additional tax relief for Quebec residents</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div id="income-types-and-deductions" class="section">
        <h2>Income Types and Deductions</h2>
        <p>The calculator handles various income types differently, reflecting Canada's tax system:</p>
        
        <h3>Employment Income</h3>

            <li>Taxed at regular rates</li>

            <li>Not subject to EI premiums (unless opted in)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Capital Gains</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>50% of capital gains are taxable</li>
            <li>Different treatment for gains before and after June 25, 2024</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Dividends</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eligible dividends are grossed up by 38% with a 15.02% federal dividend tax credit</li>
            <li>Ineligible dividends are grossed up by 15% with a 9% federal dividend tax credit</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>RRSP Deductions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Directly reduce taxable income</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div id="government-spending-visualization" class="section">

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        
        <h3>How accurate is the calculator?</h3>
        <p>The calculator provides a close estimate based on the information you provide and the latest tax rates. However, it's a simplified model and doesn't account for all possible deductions, credits, or special situations.</p>
        
        <h3>Does the calculator store my data?</h3>
        <p>No, all calculations are performed in your browser. No personal or financial information is stored on our servers.</p>
        
        <h3>How often is the calculator updated?</h3>
        <p>We update the calculator annually to reflect changes in tax rates, brackets, and government spending allocations. The current version uses 2024 tax rates.</p>
        
        <h3>Can I use the calculator for business taxes?</h3>
        <p>The calculator is designed for personal income taxes. Business taxes involve different rules and considerations.</p>
        
        <h3>How are the government spending allocations determined?</h3>
        <p>The spending allocations are based on the Public Accounts of Canada and Budget 2024 documents, which provide detailed breakdowns of federal government expenditures.</p>
        
        <h3>Does the calculator account for all possible tax credits?</h3>
        <p>The calculator includes major credits like the basic personal amount and simplified child credits, but doesn't account for all possible credits like medical expenses, tuition, or charitable donations.</p>
