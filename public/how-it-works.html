        <p>The Canada Tax Calculator is a comprehensive, user-friendly tool designed to help Canadians understand their tax obligations and see how their tax dollars contribute to government spending. This documentation explains the calculator's methodology, features, and benefits.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="calculator-methodology" class="section">
        <h2>Calculator Methodology</h2>
        
        <h3>Tax Rates and Brackets</h3>
        <p>The Canada Tax Calculator uses the latest 2024 federal and provincial tax rates and brackets to provide accurate tax estimates. The calculator includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Federal Tax Brackets: Five progressive tax brackets ranging from 15% to 33%</li>
            <li>Provincial/Territorial Tax Brackets: Specific brackets for all 13 provinces and territories</li>
            <li>CPP/QPP Contributions: Calculated based on employment income with appropriate maximums</li>
            <li>EI Premiums: Calculated based on employment income with appropriate maximums</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Basic Personal Amounts</h3>
        <p>The calculator accounts for both federal and provincial basic personal amounts (BPA), which are non-refundable tax credits that reduce the amount of tax you pay:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Federal Basic Personal Amount: $15,000 (2024)</li>
            <li>Provincial Basic Personal Amounts: Vary by province/territory</li>
            <li>Adjusted BPA for Marital Status: Increased BPA for individuals who are married or in common-law relationships</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div id="tax-calculation-process" class="section">
        <h2>Tax Calculation Process</h2>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        
        <h3>How accurate is the calculator?</h3>
        <p>The calculator provides a close estimate based on the information you provide and the latest tax rates. However, it's a simplified model and doesn't account for all possible deductions, credits, or special situations.</p>
        
        <h3>Does the calculator store my data?</h3>
        <p>No, all calculations are performed in your browser. No personal or financial information is stored on our servers.</p>
        
        <h3>How often is the calculator updated?</h3>
        <p>We update the calculator annually to reflect changes in tax rates, brackets, and government spending allocations. The current version uses 2024 tax rates.</p>
        
        <h3>Can I use the calculator for business taxes?</h3>
        <p>The calculator is designed for personal income taxes. Business taxes involve different rules and considerations.</p>
        
        <h3>How are the government spending allocations determined?</h3>
        <p>The spending allocations are based on the Public Accounts of Canada and Budget 2024 documents, which provide detailed breakdowns of federal government expenditures.</p>
        
        <h3>Does the calculator account for all possible tax credits?</h3>
        <p>The calculator includes major credits like the basic personal amount and simplified child credits, but doesn't account for all possible credits like medical expenses, tuition, or charitable donations.</p>
